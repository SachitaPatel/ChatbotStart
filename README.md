I forked this repository to get all the base files from Richard's respository.
I got the user interface for the web from a Mobile Application Development Course Assignment.

## SPChatBotStart

This application is to create an order bot for your favourite food.There are two items Burrito and Chipotle in the menu.The menu item has size and toppings.After size and toppings are added, up-sell item like tortilla chips and drink can be added.On the selection of the favourite food item, size and upsell items, total amount to be paid for the order is calculated.The customer is informed about the total amount that needs to be paid and estimated delivery time.

To run:

1. The first time run `npm install`
2. Press ctrl-f5 while your focus is in one of the files that starts with a number and is all lower case.

### Enhancement

The validations needs to be added if customer enters invalid infromation.
The online payment link should be added that redirects to the paypal account.
